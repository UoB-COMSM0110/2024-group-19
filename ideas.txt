Expanded Ideas

1)

Base Game: Monopoly - University of Bristol Edition

Base game has: properties, train stations, utilities, chance, community chest, free parking, jail, go etc...
I propse we keep the idea of properties the same, although we'll rename them to whatever we want and the
objective (collect properties & money and bankrupt the other players) remains the same, but beyond that we
we can replace the remaining squares with whatever we want. It shouldn't be too hard to implement a basic
version of this game i.e moving pieces on a board and properties, then we can add further features bit by
bit
For example we can replace the "Go to Jail" square with a "Portal" square that teleports you to a random
square and implement "Quests" into the Chance deck of cards that have a fincancial rewards. These are 2 ideas
but you can see how this game has vast oppertunity for new ideas to be implemented. 

  

2) 

Base Game: Head Soccer

On the surface this is a simple 2D soccer game, there are 2 goals at either end of the screen, the objective is
score in the opposition's net. Each character can move forwards and backwards as well as jump. In addition to this
there is kick option which raises the character's foot as well as a dash feature that allows a player to dash 
forward much faster than normal. Every so often each player can activate their 'power up' which basically pings 
the ball towards the oppositon's net.

We can add further power-ups that spawn randomly throughout the pitch, e.g faster movement, higher jumping, 
ball magnet, double-goals etc...

This should be a simple implementation, the main difficulty I see is the physics of the ball's motion.
